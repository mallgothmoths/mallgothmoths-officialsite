Hello! 

This is the official website for the band / art project The Mall Goth Moths. 
This is my first code ever, I'm sure I've made mistakes, but I just wanted to do it finish it.
I can click on buttons, they change color, they have animation, I can say I did that!
I'm working on a different project that I'll link to this website - hopefully sooner than later.
Who knew all the trial and error that goes into anything! Haha

Anyways, that's it. That's all. I appreciate feedback but be nice please or I'll cry and quit forever. 

Thank you for reading! Have a fabulous day!
